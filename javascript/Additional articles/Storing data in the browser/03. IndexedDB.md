IndexedDB is a database that is built into a browser, much more powerful than `localStorage`.

-   Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.
-   Supports transactions for reliability.
-   Supports key range queries, indexes.
-   Can store much bigger volumes of data than `localStorage`.

That power is usually excessive for traditional client-server apps. IndexedDB is intended for offline apps, to be combined with ServiceWorkers and other technologies.

The native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification [https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB), is event-based.

We can also use `async/await` with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like [https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb). That’s pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can’t replace events for all cases. So we’ll start with events, and then, after we gain an understanding of IndexedDb, we’ll use the wrapper.

> **Where’s the data?**
  Technically, the data is usually stored in the visitor’s home directory, along with browser settings, extensions, etc.

Different browsers and OS-level users have each their own independant storage.
