But maybe there is some more you should be aware of?

Also a while ago, so-called [****Tree-Shakeable Tokens****](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/22005) feature was merged into master branch. If you are like me, you probably want to know what has changed.

So it’s time to examine all these things and maybe find something new...
