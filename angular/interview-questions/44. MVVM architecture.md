MVVM architecture consists of three parts:

1.  Model
2.  View
3.  ViewModel

-   **Model** contains the structure of an entity. In simple terms it contains data of an object.
-   **View** is the visual layer of the application. It displays the data contained inside the Model. In angular terms, this will be the HTML template of a component.
-   **ViewModel** is an abstract layer of the application. A viewmodel handles the logic of the application. It manages the data of a model and displays it in the view.

**View and ViewModel** are connected with data-binding (two-way data-binding in this case). Any change in the view, the viewmodel takes a note and changes the appropriate data inside the model.
