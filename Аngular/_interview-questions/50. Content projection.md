Content projection is a pattern in which you insert, or _project_, the content you want to use inside another component. For example, you could have a `Card` component that accepts content provided by another component.

The following sections describe common implementations of content projection in Angular, including:

## Single-slot content projection
With this type of content projection, a component accepts content from a single source.

## Multi-slot content projection
In this scenario, a component accepts content from multiple sources.

## Conditional content projection
Components that use conditional content projection render content only when specific conditions are met.
