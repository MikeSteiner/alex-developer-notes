View encapsulation specifies if the component's template and styles can impact the entire program or vice versa.

**Angular offers three encapsulation methods:**

-   **Native:** The component does not inherit styles from the main HTML. Styles defined in this component's @Component decorator are only applicable to this component.
-   **Emulated (Default):** The component inherits styles from the main HTML. Styles set in the @Component decorator are only applicable to this component.
-   **None:** The component's styles are propagated back to the main HTML and therefore accessible to all components on the page. Be wary of programs that have None and Native components. Styles will be repeated in all components with Native encapsulation if they have No encapsulation.
