**Components**

In Angular, components are the basic building blocks, which control a part of the UI for any application.

A component is defined using the **@Component** decorator. Every component consists of three parts, the template which loads the view for the component, a stylesheet which defines the look and feel for the component, and a class that contains the business logic for the component.

```javascript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-test', templateUrl: './test.component.html', styleUrls: ['./test.component.css'] }) export lass TestComponent implements OnInit { constructor() {} ngOnInit() { } }
```
