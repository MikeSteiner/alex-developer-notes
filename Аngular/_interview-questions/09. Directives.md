### What are directives in Angular?

A directive is a class in Angular that is declared with a **@Directive** decorator.

**1. Component directives**

These form the main class in directives. **Instead** of @Directive decorator we use **@Component** decorator to declare these directives. These directives have a view, a stylesheet and a selector property.

**2. Structural directives**

-   These directives are generally used to manipulate DOM elements.
-   Every structural directive has a ‘ * ’ sign before them.
-   We can apply these directives to any DOM element.

Let’s see some built-in structural directives in action:

```HTML
<div *ngIf="isReady" class="display_name"> {{name}} </div> 

<div>class="details" *ngFor="let x of details" >
<p>{{x.name}}</p>
<p> {{x.address}}</p>
<p>{{x.age}}</p>
</div>
```

 In the above example, we can *ngIf and *ngFor directives being used.

*ngIf is used to check a boolean value and if it’s truthy,the div element will be displayed.

*ngFor is used to iterate over a list and display each item of the list.

**3. Attribute Directives**

These directives are used to change the look and behaviour of a DOM element.

We’re going to create an attribute directive:

```javascript

import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({ selector: '[appBlueBackground]' })
export class BlueBackgroundDirective { 
	constructor(el:ElementRef) { 
		el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
	}
}

```

In the command terminal, navigate to the directory of the angular app and type the following command to generate a directive: `ng g directive blueBackground`

The following directive will be generated. Manipulate the directive to look like this:
