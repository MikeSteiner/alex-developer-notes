RxJS is an acronym that stands for Reactive Extensions for JavaScript. It is used to enable the use of observables in our JavaScript project, allowing us to do reactive programming. RxJS is utilized in many popular frameworks, including Angular since it allows us to compose our asynchronous or callback-based code into a sequence of operations executed on a data stream that releases values from a publisher to a subscriber. Other programming languages, such as Java and Python, offer packages that allow them to develop reactive programs utilizing observables.

Most of the time, rxJs is used in HTTP calls with angular. Because http streams are asynchronous data, we can subscribe to them and apply filters to them.

**Example:** The following is a simple example of how RxJs can be utilized with HTTP calls.

```typescript
let  stream1 = httpc.get("https://www.example.com/somedata");
 let stream2 = stream1.pipe(filter(x=>x>3));
 stream2.subscribe(res=>this.Success(res),res=>this.Error(res));
```
