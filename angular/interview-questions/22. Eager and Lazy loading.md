-   **Loading:** The eager loading technique is the default module-loading strategy. Eager loading feature modules are loaded before the program begins. This is primarily utilized for small-scale applications.
-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading loads the feature modules dynamically as needed. This speeds up the application. It is utilized for larger projects where all of the modules are not required at the start.
