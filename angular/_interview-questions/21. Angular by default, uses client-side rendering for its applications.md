Can one make an angular application to render on the server-side?

Yes, angular provides a technology called **Angular Universal**, which can be used to render applications on the server-side.

The advantages of using Angular Universal are:

-   First time users can instantly see a view of the application. This benefits in providing **better user experience**.
-   Many search engines expect pages in plain HTML, thus, Universal can make sure that your content is available on every search engine, which leads to **better SEO**.
-   Any server-side rendered application **loads faster** since rendered pages are available to the browser sooner.
