## Dependency injection (DI)
https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services#dependency-injection-di

Dependency injection, or DI, is one of the fundamental concepts in Angular. DI is wired into the Angular framework and allows classes with Angular decorators, such as Components, Directives, Pipes, and Injectables, to configure dependencies that they need.

Two main roles exist in the DI system: dependency consumer and dependency provider.

Angular facilitates the interaction between dependency consumers and dependency providers using an abstraction called [Injector](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#injector). When a dependency is requested, the injector checks its registry to see if there is an instance already available there. If not, a new instance is created and stored in the registry. Angular creates an application-wide injector (also known as "root" injector) during the application bootstrap process, as well as any other injectors as needed. In most cases you don't need to manually create injectors, but you should know that there is a layer that connects providers and consumers.

*Това е и една от разликите между AngularJS and Angular, това че DI механизмът е вграден във фреймуърка.*

The `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` decorator defines a class as a service in Angular and allows Angular to inject it into a component as a _dependency_. Likewise, the `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` decorator indicates that a component, class, pipe, or NgModule _has_ a dependency on a service.

-   The **_injector_** is the main mechanism. Angular creates an application-wide injector for you during the bootstrap process, and additional injectors as needed. You don't have to create injectors.
-   An injector creates dependencies and maintains a **_container_ of dependency instances** that it reuses, if possible.
-   A **_provider_** is an object that tells an injector how to obtain or create a dependency


For any dependency that you need in your app, you must register a provider with the application's injector, so that the injector can use the provider to create new instances. For a service, the provider is typically the service class itself.

A dependency doesn't have to be a service —it could be a function, for example, or a value.

When Angular creates a new instance of a component class, it determines which services or other dependencies that component needs by looking at the constructor parameter types. For example, the constructor of `HeroListComponent` needs `HeroService`.

src/app/hero-list.component.ts (constructor)

      `constructor(private service: HeroService) { }`
    

When Angular discovers that a component depends on a service, it first checks if the injector has any existing instances of that service. If a requested service instance doesn't yet exist, the injector makes one using the registered provider and adds it to the injector before returning the service to Angular.

When all requested services have been resolved and returned, Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments.

The process of `HeroService` injection looks something like this.

### Providing services

You must register at least one _provider_ of any service you are going to use. The provider can be part of the service's own metadata, making that service available everywhere, or you can register providers with specific modules or components. You register providers in the metadata of the service (in the `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` decorator), or in the `@[NgModule](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule)()` or `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)()` metadata

-   By default, the Angular CLI command [`ng generate service`](https://angular.io/cli/generate) registers a provider with the root injector for your service by including provider metadata in the `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` decorator. The tutorial uses this method to register the provider of HeroService class definition.
    

-         `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)({  providedIn: 'root', })`
        
    
    When you provide the service at the root level, Angular creates a single, shared instance of `HeroService` and injects it into any class that asks for it. Registering the provider in the `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` metadata also allows Angular to optimize an app by removing the service from the compiled application if it isn't used, a process known as _tree-shaking_.
    
-   When you register a provider with a [specific NgModule](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules), the same instance of a service is available to all components in that NgModule. To register at this level, use the `providers` property of the `@[NgModule](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule)()` decorator.
    
-         `@[NgModule](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule)({   providers: [   BackendService,   Logger  ],  … })`
        
    
-   When you register a provider at the component level, you get a new instance of the service with each new instance of that component. At the component level, register a service provider in the `providers` property of the `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)()` metadata.
    
    src/app/hero-list.component.ts (component providers)
    

-         `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)({   selector:    'app-hero-list',   templateUrl: './hero-list.component.html',   providers:  [ HeroService ] })`
