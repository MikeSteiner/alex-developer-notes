RouterLink is an anchor tag directive that gives the router authority over those elements. Because the navigation routes are set.

**Example:**Â As seen below, you may pass string values to the router-link directive.

```plaintext
<h1>Example of an Angular Router</h1>
<nav>
  <a routerLink="/home" >Home Page of our website</a>
  <a routerLink="/about-us" >About us</a>
</nav>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```
