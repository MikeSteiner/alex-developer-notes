Injectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine in which NgModule, Component, or Directive you should declare a provider.

The applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into many small well-encapsulated modules, that are by themselves split up into a well-defined tree of components.

There can be sections of your page that works in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs. Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.

With hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.

## Types of injector hierarchies

Injectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications. By understanding these rules, you can determine in which NgModule, Component, or Directive you should declare a provider.

Angular has two injector hierarchies:

![[Pasted image 20221020163431.png]]

### `ModuleInjector`

The `ModuleInjector` can be configured in one of two ways by using:

-   The `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` `providedIn` property to refer to `@[NgModule](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule)()`, or `root`
-   The `@[NgModule](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule)()` `providers` array

Tree-shaking and @Injectable()

Using the `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` `providedIn` property is preferable to using the `@[NgModule](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule)()` `providers` array. With `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` `providedIn`, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.

Tree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it. Read more about [tree-shakable providers](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services#providing-services) in [Introduction to services and dependency injection](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services).

`ModuleInjector` is configured by the `@[NgModule.providers](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule#providers)` and `[NgModule.imports](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule#imports)` property. `ModuleInjector` is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the `[NgModule.imports](https://angular.io/api/core/NgModule#imports)` recursively.

Child `ModuleInjector` hierarchies are created when lazy loading other `@NgModules`.

Provide services with the `providedIn` property of `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` as follows:

```
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root ModuleInjector
})
export class ItemService {
  name = 'telephone';
}
```

The `@[Injectable](https://angular.io/api/core/Injectable)()` decorator identifies a service class. The `providedIn` property configures a specific `ModuleInjector`, here `root`, which makes the service available in the `root` `ModuleInjector`.

#### Platform injector

There are two more injectors above `root`, an additional `ModuleInjector` and `NullInjector()`.

Consider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in `main.ts`:

      `[platformBrowserDynamic](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser-dynamic/platformBrowserDynamic)().bootstrapModule(AppModule).then(ref => {…})`
    

The `bootstrapModule()` method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the `AppModule`. This is the `root` `ModuleInjector`.

The `[platformBrowserDynamic](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser-dynamic/platformBrowserDynamic)()` method creates an injector configured by a `PlatformModule`, which contains platform-specific dependencies. This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration. For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running. You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying `extraProviders` using the `[platformBrowser](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/platformBrowser)()` function.

The next parent injector in the hierarchy is the `NullInjector()`, which is the top of the tree. If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the `NullInjector()`, you'll get an error unless you've used `@[Optional](https://angular.io/api/core/Optional)()` because ultimately, everything ends at the `NullInjector()` and it returns an error or, in the case of `@[Optional](https://angular.io/api/core/Optional)()`, `null`. For more information on `@[Optional](https://angular.io/api/core/Optional)()`, see the [`@Optional()` section](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#optional) of this guide.

The following diagram represents the relationship between the `root` `ModuleInjector` and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.

![NullInjector, ModuleInjector, root injector](https://angular.io/generated/images/guide/dependency-injection/injectors.svg)

While the name `root` is a special alias, other `ModuleInjector` hierarchies don't have aliases. You have the option to create `ModuleInjector` hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child `ModuleInjector` hierarchies.

All requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the `bootstrapModule()` method, or registered all providers with `root` in their own services.

### `ElementInjector`

Angular creates `ElementInjector` hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.

Providing a service in the `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)()` decorator using its `providers` or `viewProviders` property configures an `ElementInjector`. For example, the following `TestComponent` configures the `ElementInjector` by providing the service as follows:

      `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)({   …   providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }] }) export class TestComponent`
    

**NOTE**:  
See the [resolution rules](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#resolution-rules) section to understand the relationship between the `ModuleInjector` tree and the `ElementInjector` tree.

When you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the `ElementInjector` at that component instance. It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the [resolution rules](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#resolution-rules) section.

When the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.

#### `@[Directive](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive)()` and `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)()`

A component is a special type of directive, which means that just as `@[Directive](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive)()` has a `providers` property, `@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component)()` does too. This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the `providers` property. When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the `providers` property, that provider belongs to the `ElementInjector` of that component or directive. Components and directives on the same element share an injector.
