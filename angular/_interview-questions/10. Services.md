-   **Modules**

Services are objects which get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. The main objective of a service is to share data, functions with different components of an Angular application.

A service is defined using a **@Injectable** decorator. A function defined inside a service can be invoked from any component or directive.

To create a service, run the following command: `ng g s test-service`

The service will be created inside src/app/test-service.service.ts:

```typescript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; 

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class TestServiceService {
	constructor() { } 
}
```
