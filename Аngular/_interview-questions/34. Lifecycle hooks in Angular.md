Every component in Angular has a lifecycle, and different phases it goes through from the time of creation to the time it's destroyed. Angular provides **hooks** to tap into these phases and trigger changes at specific phases in a lifecycle.

-   **ngOnChanges( )** This hook/method is called before ngOnInit and whenever one or more input properties of the component change.  
    This method/hook receives a SimpleChanges object which contains the previous and current values of the property.
-   **ngOnInit( )** This hook gets called once, after the ngOnChanges hook.  
    It initializes the component and sets the input properties of the component.
-   **ngDoCheck( )** It gets called after ngOnChanges and **ngOnInit** and is used to detect and act on changes that cannot be detected by Angular.  
    We can implement our change detection algorithm in this hook. **ngAfterContentInit( )** It gets called after the first **ngDoCheck** hook. This hook responds after the content gets projected inside the component.
-   **ngAfterContentChecked( )** It gets called after **ngAfterContentInit** and every subsequent **ngDoCheck**. It responds after the projected content is checked.
-   **ngAfterViewInit( )** It responds after a component's view, or a child component's view is initialized.
-   **ngAfterViewChecked( )** It gets called after **ngAfterViewInit**, and it responds after the component's view, or the child component's view is checked.
-   **ngOnDestroy( )** It gets called just before Angular destroys the component. This hook can be used to clean up the code and detach event handlers.

Let’s understand how to use **ngOnInit** hook, since it’s the most often used hook. If one has to process a lot of data during component creation, it’s better to do it inside **ngOnInit** hook rather than the constructor: 

```plaintext
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

      @Component({
        selector: 'app-test',
        templateUrl: './test.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./test.component.css']
      })
      export class TestComponent implements OnInit {
        constructor() { }

        ngOnInit() {
          this.processData();
        }

        processData(){
          // Do something..
        }

      }
```

 As you can see we have imported OnInit but we have used **ngOnInit** function. This principle should be used with the rest of the hooks as well.
