The process of synchronizing a model with a view is known as Change Detection. Even when utilizing the ng Model to implement two-way binding, which is syntactic sugar on top of a unidirectional flow. Change detection is incredibly fast, but as an app's complexity and the number of components increase, change detection will have to do more and more work.

Change Detection Mechanism-moves only ahead and never backward, beginning with the root component and ending with the last component. This is what one-way data flow entails. The tree of components is the architecture of an Angular application. Each component is a child, but the child is not a parent. A $digest loop is no longer required with the one-way flow.
