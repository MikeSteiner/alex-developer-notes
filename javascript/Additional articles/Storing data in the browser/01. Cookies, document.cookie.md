Cookies are small strings of data that are stored directly in the browser. They are a part of the HTTP protocol, defined by the [RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) specification.

Cookies are usually set by a web-server using the response `Set-Cookie` HTTP-header. Then, the browser automatically adds them to (almost) every request to the same domain using the `Cookie` HTTP-header.

One of the most widespread use cases is authentication:

1.  Upon sign in, the server uses the `Set-Cookie` HTTP-header in the response to set a cookie with a unique “session identifier”.
2.  Next time when the request is sent to the same domain, the browser sends the cookie over the net using the `Cookie` HTTP-header.
3.  So the server knows who made the request.

We can also access cookies from the browser, using `document.cookie` property.

There are many tricky things about cookies and their options. In this chapter we’ll cover them in detail.
